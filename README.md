##  Purpose <a name = "Purpose"></a>

The Purpose of this website is to showcase my development skills through both digital and informative mediums. Showcasing my skills through the specific information in the site like my past experience, knowledge of different tech stacks and my soft skills, but also through the website itself. At such an early stage of the journey as a developer the website was created with the plan to scale and update it as my skillset broadens while still starting with a solid base in both code and styling.

## Features <a name = "Features"></a>
The site features 4 pages (with a 5th called 'Projects' being added at some point in the future). Each page is styled differently but keeping the same theme of simplicity and minimalismn throughout. I focused on monochromatic color pallets and on text styling to catch the viewers eye as opposed to big colors and images.

Some of the features and functionality include being responsive over mobile and desktop platforms using both CSS grid and flexbox, enabling me to create responsive pages but also different components on each page including sections, articles and even titles.

Other features and components include cards containers, social links that take viewers to my social pages and allow them to download my CV.

## Target <a name = "Target"></a>
The target audience for this site is anyone scouting me for a job. With the focus on style, design and the responsiveness of the code I'd hope to showcase my ability to excel in all areas of front end development (planning, design, implementation) and not just the ability to right good code.
